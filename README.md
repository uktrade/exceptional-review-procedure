**UI for reporting feeback for Exceptional Review procedure - the Department for International Trade (DIT)**  

---

## Development

### Installing
    $ git clone https://github.com/uktrade/exceptional-review-procedure
    $ cd exceptional-review-procedure
    $ virtualenv .venv -p python3.6
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ make install_requirements


### Requirements
[Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/)

[Redis](https://redis.io/)


### Configuration

Secrets such as API keys and environment specific configurations are placed in `conf/env/secrets-do-not-commit` - a file that is not added to version control. To create a template secrets file with dummy values run `make secrets`.

## CSS development

We use SASS CSS pre-compiler. If you're doing front-end work your local machine will also need the following dependencies:

[node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
[SASS](https://rubygems.org/gems/sass/versions/3.4.22)

Then run:

    $ npm install yarn
    $ yarn install --production=false

We add compiled CSS files to version control. This will sometimes result in conflicts if multiple developers are working on the same SASS files. However, by adding the compiled CSS to version control we avoid having to install node, npm, node-sass, etc to non-development machines.

You should not edit CSS files directly, instead edit their SCSS counterparts.

## Session

Signed cookies are used as the session backend to avoid using a database. We therefore must avoid storing non-trivial data in the session, because the browser will be exposed to the data.
